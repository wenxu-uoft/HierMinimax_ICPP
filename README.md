# HierMinimax_ICPP
Code for Distributed Minimax Fair Optimization over Hierarchical Networks (ICPP 2024).

## This repo contains all code needed to replicate the results.
The code for the convex loss function setting is in `HierMinimax_ICPP2024_CVX_(final).ipynb` and the code for the non-convex loss function setting is in `HierMinimax_ICPP2024_NONCVX_(final).ipynb`.

After running all blocks (e.g., Runtime -> Run all in Google Colab), all results will be stored in the `results` folder and all figures for comparison of benchmarks will be stored in the `images` folder. 

We strongly recommend you use Google Colab to run these Jupyter Notebooks. Otherwise, you will need to install all required packages by uncommenting the first code block in each of the files.
